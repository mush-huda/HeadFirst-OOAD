Book : **Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**

Some of the basic good coding practices advocated in this book:

* Use Enumeration
    * Enums provides type safety and value safety
    
* Mismatched Object Type
    * Objects should do what their names indicate
    * Each object should represent a single concept
    * Unused properties are a dead giveaway
    
* Encapsulation
    * Encapsulate the parts of the app that might vary away from the parts that will stay the same -> Encapsulate what varies
    * Anytime you see duplicate code, look for place to encapsulate
    
* Class
    * A class should have only a single responsibility (SRP)
    * A class should have only one reason to change
    * Protect your class from unnecessary changes
    
* Delegation
    * Delegation makes our objects less dependent on each other and can be reused easily

* The one constant in software analysis and design: CHANGE
